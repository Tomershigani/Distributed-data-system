# Distributed-data-system
In this project, I built a distributed database for movie theaters. The project included loading and preprocessing data, 
analyzing and understanding the data to draw insights, designing a distributed database, and implementing the design using Spark and SQL.

In the first part, I loaded and preprocessed the data and applied transformations using Spark. This served as
a preface to the analysis and implementation parts.

In the second part, I analyzed the dataset using SQL and derived insights related to user behavior and queries conducted on the
cinema website. I also used visualizations to support my analysis.

In the third part, I designed a distributed database based on the insights obtained from the analysis. I then implemented the
design using PySpark and divided the implementation into five directories, one for each site according to my design.
